Dolphin is an emulator for running GameCube and Wii games on Windows,
Linux, macOS, and recent Android devices. It's licensed under the terms

## System Requirements

### Desktop

* OS
    * Windows (10 or higher).
    * Linux.
    * macOS (11.0 Catalina or higher).
    * Unix-like systems other than Linux are not officially supported but might work.
* Processor
    * A CPU with SSE2 support.
    * A modern CPU (3 GHz and Dual Core, not older than 2008) is highly recommended.
* Graphics
    * A reasonably modern graphics card (Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 3.3).
    * A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 4.4 is recommended.

### Android

* OS
    * Android (5.0 Lollipop or higher).
* Processor
    * A processor with support for 64-bit applications (either ARMv8 or x86-64).
* Graphics
    * A graphics processor that supports OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher. Performance varies heavily with [driver quality](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2013/09/26/dolphin-emulator-and-opengl-drivers-hall-fameshame/).
    * A graphics processor that supports standard desktop OpenGL features is recommended for best performance.

Dolphin can only be installed on devices that satisfy the above requirements. Attempting to install on an unsupported device will fail and display an error message.

## Building for Windows

Use the solution file `Source/dolphin-emu.sln` to build Dolphin on Windows.
Dolphin targets the latest MSVC shipped with Visual Studio or Build Tools.
Other compilers might be able to build Dolphin on Windows but have not been
tested and are not recommended to be used. Git and latest Windows SDK must be
installed when building.

Make sure to pull submodules before building:
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
